# Quantum-Computing-VQE-HOMO-LUMO-for-Hydroflouric-Acid
HOMO LUMO is an opprotuniy to connect Quantum Computing Methods and Material science
in the engineering and application and realistic level. 

In chemistry, HOMO and LUMO are types of molecular orbitals (MOs).
The acronyms stand for highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively. 

By considering HOMO and LUMO MOs we can reduce the number of orbitals, which means those that are less active or 
not actively rid out of the calculation and among lead the computation. In the calculation which are done by 
quantum computing, it also reduce the time of calculation enormously. 

In this project without reduction the project to the HOMO LUMO gap, the problem should be solved via 12 qubits,
by by HOMO LUMO active space trasnformation it can be done by 4 qubits. 

Somehow it is key to bringing quantum computing and usage of the ab initio method in computational chemistry 
to the realisitc application level such as biology, biochemistry, polymeric, and all of the usage of materials 
in industry and engineering.
